# bot_ames
A handy Discord bot for PC:RD stuff. Mostly.

Ames is coded on the rewrite branch of Discord's python API using Python3.7

~~The code is pretty messy~~

Note: Ames loses a lot of her functionality without access to private database.

## main.py
Run `re_ames.py`

## bot prefix
Ames' prefix is `.` and `$`. Use `.help` to get started.

## Dependencies
Here are the python headers used
* asyncio
* PIL
* discord
* mysql connector
* ast

## Database
Ames uses a private database along with [Hatsune Note's PrincessGuide Database](https://github.com/superk589/PrincessGuide).
