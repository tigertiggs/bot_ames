{
'name':		"Eriko",
'pos':		"Vanguard",
'role':		"CB Queen/Crit monster",
'rank': 	(5, 13),
'ue':		3,

'brief':	
"Eriko is a solid physical DPS, although a bit of a glass cannon. With the introduction of her UE, she now does a lot more damage, should she crit. She is one of the highest DPS-ers in CB.",

'strat':
"Eriko self-buffs so she can handle herself without buffers, but can be squishy so add healer if need be. After getting her UE, her full potential is realised when you time her UB along with her atk and crit buff skill.",

'do': 
[
"Put her in a physical team",
"Accept her love"
],


'dont': 
[
"Refuse her love"
],


'team':
"Preferably in a physical team with a tank like Nozomi, and perhaps a buffer/healer if you believe the dps lost can be made back with the buffs provided."
