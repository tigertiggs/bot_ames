'name':		"Kaori",
'pos':		"Frontmost Vanguard",
'role':		"Imagine Breaker",
'rank': 	(5, 14),
'ue':		3,

'brief':	
"She really likes to punch things, and it hurts, especially if it crits. Her UE makes her punches hurt even more. I don't think she does anything else besides punching things. She is among the highest DPS-ers in CB.",

'strat':
"3 stars is recommended as she can be squishy before then. Because she is frontmost vanguard, there are only a few tanks that stand in front of her. Do keep this in mind if you find that the boss is tough. Other than that, Kaori can handle herself as the tank in weaker bosses battles.",

'do': 
[
"Let her punch things"
],


'dont': 
[
"Nothing, really"
],


'team':
"She works well with bosses and can go into any generic physical team. If she has her UE, she can do with some attack speed buffs as she gains a passive damage buff that stacks with every usuage of her skill."
